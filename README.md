# Flood-Prediction
Flooding is a recurrent problem in Lagos State, Nigeria, causing significant infrastructure
damage, economic down-turn, and displacement. This report analyzes weather data for Lagos
State to understand the factors influencing flood occurrence and develop a predictive model.
Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between precipitation and flooding, with a clear
seasonal pattern. The developed model, Decision-Tree Classifier demonstrates promising
accuracy in predicting flood events.

# Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from
https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services and it includes daily weather
data for Lagos from 2004 to July 2024. Key variables include temperature, precipitation,
humidity, wind speed, and flood occurrence.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
● Handled missing values by filling them with 'not_specified' for categorical variables and 0
for numerical variables.
● Datetime was standardized to the datetime format.

# Data Visualization and Exploration
Here is the link to my Colab notebook, where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of weather
data for Lagos State to predict flood occurrences. The notebook includes data cleaning,
visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps, using a Decision Tree
Classifier for prediction.

# Result and Conclusion
This analysis provides a data-driven approach to predicting potential flood occurrences in Lagos
State. While the model suggests no floods for the remaining days of July 2024, it highlights the
importance of continuous monitoring and updating predictive models with new data. Further
research could involve incorporating additional variables and exploring different modeling
techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.
